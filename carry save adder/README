Carry save adder is the hardware used to add binary numbers. It is much more efficient than the ripple arry adder and less complicated than the carry look head adder and reduces delay greatly. 
The following folder contains codes for different verilog modules used to construct a 4-bit carry save adder
Follow the pdf document for the explanation 
Here we add s and c using a ripple carry adder, this can also be done using carry look ahead adder to reduce the delay further
The main module is the carry_save.v and full_adder.v is a module used for instantiation
